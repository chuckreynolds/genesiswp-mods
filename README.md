# GenesisWP-mods

Needed a place to store a common set of functions and options I commonly use on
Genesis WordPress projects. Mostly to clean up the admin area and set some basic
options. I made a repo as others expressed interest in having access to and adding
to such a repo.

This is not a plugin, not meant to be, just simply a place I can store all these to
grab an hit the ground running.

Pull Requests and/or Issues welcome... but please... have good reasoning.
